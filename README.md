## Issues with Data Analysis
- **Data Source**: The analysis is based solely on the number of blog posts tagged with specific keywords on Nvidia's website. This may not accurately reflect the overall investment or growth in each field.
- **Market Monopoly**: Nvidia does not have a monopoly in Quantum Computing as it does in AI, potentially leading to fewer exclusive blog posts.
- **Historical Data**: Nvidia's website began in 2011, limiting the historical data available for analysis.
- **Marketing Influence**: The number of blog posts may be influenced by the size and focus of Nvidia's marketing department, rather than direct investment or technological advancement.
